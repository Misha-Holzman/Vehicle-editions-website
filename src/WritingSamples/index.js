              Have you ever wanted to walk inside a painting, sit down and experience the work from the inside? Ship and Dock/Nights
              and Days or The Gazer is like a painting: you have to keep looking at what is before you so you know not only what you’re
              seeing but what you’re feeling as well. This mixed media assemblage, the primary work in this exhibition, takes up an
              entire room and carries psychological power.
            </p>
            <p className='dennis-text dennis-article-writing'>
              Entering a darkened space through a floor-to-ceiling black curtain, you encounter a structure beyond which, in one direction,
              is a slowly, gradually changing sky beginning at the horizon line. The whole installation is miniaturized yet human-scale,
              like a great big, exploded-open Joseph Cornell box.
            </p>
            <p className='dennis-text dennis-article-writing'>
              A bench is placed conveniently against a dark wall pierced with scattered holes that allow tiny and tinier lights to shine through.
              Sit down with the starry wall behind you and gaze at, and through, the structure. It’s mesmerizing and invites you to linger and
              contemplate the passage of time. The structure and the walls on either side and behind are dark with a greater depth than any empty
              black because this color is, in fact, a dark marine blue.
            </p>
            <p className='dennis-text dennis-article-writing'>
              The structure is a dock with two sheds. One weather beaten shed, nearer the viewer, to the left on the dock, is clad in corrugated
              metal with authentic signs of aging: dings and scrapes. Its door has a weathered, cross-hatched safety-glass window through which
              a lit bulb exudes orangey-yellowish light with a brighter center, like the glow from a gas lamp, only the filament identifies this
              lamp as an industrial-type, if delicate electrical bulb. On entering the space with its many parts, darkness and this light, this
              lamp suggests a Bec Auer gas lamp of the type familiar from Marcel Duchamp’s Etant Donnés. We look through something to see a view
              beyond, a light on the other side of the solid structure. Only there is no figure here except oneself and a haunting feeling of
              loneliness. Like Duchamp, Donna Dennis has controlled the conditions under which the viewer experiences the work. One must be part
              of the work to see it.
            </p>

            <p className='dennis-text dennis-article-writing'>The piece changes, even though nothing moves but light. This is not a static sculpture. There is a subtle though constant state
              of change, augmented by the gentle sounds of water lapping up on a shore, swirls and eddies, droplets of water, tidal sounds.
              Waves pull back, rigging that is not tied fast quietly clatters, breezes funnel through the dock and over water. There’s an eerie
              cosmic whoosh that complements the surrounding darkness.
            </p>
            <p className='dennis-text dennis-article-writing'>
              The other shed, further from the viewer and to the far right at the end of a walkway, stands on an elevated structure with a dark
              side facing the viewer and a light side facing left. This light side lends a surreal quality to the scene. The gravity and sharp
              contrasts of light and dark on the sides of this form suggest the melancholy of Giorgio de Chirico’s abandoned cityscapes and
              the relationships he creates between buildings in space.
            </p>
            <p className='dennis-text dennis-article-writing'>
              The dock is set on what look like concrete pylons whose square footings suggest water underneath. The viewer may be walking
              on that water. The crossbeams, the gangplank and stairways ck create many geometric shapes, like erector sets or metal shelving:
              crisscrossing patterns and a variety of exes and rectangular framing. Drooping cables or fuel pipes connect into stanchions that
              resemble plumbing fixtures, rounded at the top, as if they have shut-off valves or switches for the flow of liquids or current
              running inside the sheathing. Or they are hawsers, protected from the elements inside metal tubing where those strong cables
              penetrate the deck.
            </p>

            <p className='dennis-text dennis-article-writing'>
              This is a durational work because beyond the dock the projection of sky above the horizon changes gradually from day to night to day,
              from painterly sky blues to dark night with brushstroked stars as a ship changes from white against the night sky to black against
              the daytime skies in the distance. Thus the elements of engineering and technology that exist here in a three-dimensional space,
              also includes the fourth dimension of time. And, though that horizon changes, it’s always night for the viewer with the stars
              shining behind us..
            </p>
            <p className='dennis-text dennis-article-writing'>
              This scene may represent a vast lake in northern Minnesota where typically fish houses and small cabin structures can be seen
              from the shore. The scale of the work suggests that this may represent one of the Great Lakes because the ship, an ore ship
              carrying coal, is so small, so far in the distance. And what looks like a heap of rubble under the dock suggests piled up coal
            </p>
            <p className='dennis-text dennis-article-writing'>
              The viewer is struck by the precision Donna Dennis employed in creating the overall construction, the sound and the lighting.
              This reflects the attention brought to bear on the locations where the artist made her beautiful gouache drawings that hang in
              a separate room, and the elaborate preparations to accomplish her installation, first constructed in the studio, then disassembled
              and recreated at Lesley Heller.
