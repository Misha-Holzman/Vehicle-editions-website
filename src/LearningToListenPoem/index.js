          what is real is what I hear when I am
          <br />
          listening and my mind is still and I can
          <br />
          hear you without interrupting you with
          <br />
          my thoughts
          <br />
          <br />
          speak slowly please I am trying to
          <br />
          listen yet the trying part keeps me
          <br />
          from the listening part
          <br />
          <br />
          I will stop trying and then I can
          <br />
          relax and just listen to your voice
          <br />
          and the words that you say only I must
          <br />
          be careful not to feel too much about
          <br />
          the sound of your voice because I might
          <br />
          not hear your words but hear your
          <br />
          voice instead and hear the thoughts
          <br />
          the sound of your voice evoke in my mind
          <br />
          <br />
          and if I am careful I will be busy
          <br />
          with carefulness with concern and with
          <br />
          self consciousness and how will I hear
          <br />
          you then?
          <br />
          <br />
          speak slowly please
          <br />
          I am learning to listen
          <br />
          and when you help me hear you
          <br />
          what you say is as real for me as it is real
          <br />
          for you
