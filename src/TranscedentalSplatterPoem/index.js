          experience is what's snatched from danger
          
          no reasoning

          no proof

          just see what it is
          begin with intelligence and end up in the natural world


          the moon the sun the planets

          harmony of the spheres


          a mink

          a mother loon and two babies

          a looney bin of about eight looks all singing at once

          tracks of a moose or caribou

          wid irieses

          hawks

          many kinds of leeches

          lots of soft and spongey leeches
          seagulls

          dragonflies and dragonfly nymphs

          some beetle-looking things
          
          snails

          long leeches

          fly-in fishermen
          other canoests
          pink and purp[le and yellow wildflowers
          tiny little red wildflowers
          tiny little red wildflowerslots of little float planetsno rowboats
          mushrooms growing on the ground and growing on trees
          a beach made of birch logs
          a very fat robin
          minnows
          a lot of beaver lodges
          no beavers
          yellow waterlilies
          a lot of mosquitoes
          squirrels
          quite a few different kinds of spiders
          crows
          many other kinds of birds and buges I don't know the names for
          the trees were conifers
          many bushes
          march grasses
          a grayish
          heron
          terns
          lady's slippers
          distances measured in nautical miles
          from the westbound transcontinental line
          Armstrong is not a scheduled stop
          phone in the request in advance
          then throw the canoe in the freight caribou
          and paddle north for several hours

          we met Jim or Jack
          who runs a $30,000
          outfit with backhoes

          Anita made pancakes
          fried eggs, fried
          canned luncheon
          meat and very
          good coffeee

          Bud is a car dealer
          in Kokomo, Indiana
